Most commercial platforms **automate your receipt** emails which will at most times seem unprofessional as it gives machine like answers to your customers. The emails will often be **overlooked and unopened** as they offer little in terms of a great customer experience. 

Receipt emails are an example of **transactional emails**. Other transactional emails include: shipping notifications, support requests, purchase receipts, legal notices and policy updates, and password reset requests. 

Many marketers and developers assume that invoice emails, like other transactional emails, should be dull and text only but there's a huge opportunity with these emails. They respond to confirmation or interaction of an action done by your customer. You can easily **convert this into a returning customer** by customizing your email template to have more call to actions. 

In this article, we explore 5 most important tips for developing the perfect receipt email template to keep your email confirmations from falling into a groove.

### 1. Formality - Your voice should reflect your brand

This is not just any other email template. You need to be attentive to details when developing this template. 
When developing an invoice email template it is recommended that marketers follow the 80/20 rule. **80% should be the confirmation of the request by the customer, while 20% of the template should be used for promotional purposes of your brand**. 

The fact that receipt email templates don't require you to have an opt-out option as the email is responding to a critical action done by your customer. It is also an email many customers won’t neglect and therefore and promotional content of your brand could easily convert in new leads, traffic and maintaining returning customers. 

For example, most of newsletter email templates are generic and informal use of “Hi there”, “Hi [Name]” is popular. On the other hand, receipt email template confirmations require you to address the customer formally  by the use of “Dear Sir/Madam”, “Dear Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms”, “Hello[First-Name]”

The use of conversational tone is greatly recommended, as the customer will feel engaged when reading the receipt.
