<a href="https://uploadme.ai">Mindful Industries</a> are an artificial intelligence company. They've created an AI ever-living (immortal) doppelg√§nger of real humans and are **sending tens of thousands of emails a month with Mailgun**.

Here we speak with their **Founder, Jan Kremlacek**, about how they used <a href="https://htmlemail.io#templates">HTML Email templates</a> to create an email library and embed in their codebase in less than 1 day.

### What was the challenge you were facing?

The main challenge was effort to have a **standardised internal library** to deliver transactional emails in our design. Let me
be more clear, we did not stress so much on the design (as "keep it simple" works for us), but **we wanted coherent library** do serve emails **without spending months in development**.

Another important aspect for us was an ability to inline HTML emails on our side and to **keep the code clean and maintainable** for future use. And of course we wanted code which **works across email clients**.

### How did HTML Email templates help solve this problem?

Your templates helped us a lot! We took the basic one, then **used your knowledge of how to structure HTML email**, which CSS inlining works and which not, and created our own simple components (like the skeleton, buttons, tables, etc.) to fit our design and code work flow.

These components are mostly just pieces of what you did + **SCSS variables** to fit our styling.

The brilliance of your work was the fact that we made and plugged all the new HTML templates into our design and codebase in **less then 1 day**.

### What were the results?

In less than **1 day** we were able to establish **fully working HTML email** in our own design fitting our own development process.

It works as now we develop without any maintenance or additional code. In other words, **it works perfectly**. We've had no bug reports from
our customers about the HTML emails functionality.
