Have you ever sent a newsletter to thousands of people and have a very low opening rate? Most of us who deal with email have.

Many business rely on email newsletters to stay in touch with their followers and customer relationships and keep their companies top of mind with their audiences, often their company or website will have numerous news, products, updates, or upcoming events they would like to share.

In this case you should know that, well executed newsletter is a powerful email tool with multiple benefits, which is why it’s crucial to ensure your newsletter design is visually appealing. If it looks good and works correctly in the reader's email client they are more likely to open and click.

Creating an email newsletter isn’t just a case of typing a rough paragraph and attaching a link. It needs to be treated as what it is a key cog in your marketing wheel, so that to make a great newsletter we should take in mind the following points.

### 1. An appealing header

Your newsletter is the equivalent of a magazine, newspaper or website, so that it needs appealing header to sit at the very top of your newsletter, which will include the title. Remember that your title is the main key to attract your client to open your email and complete or not.

Be aware, one of the single biggest mistakes a marketer can make is to stray too far from the brand voice of your business. Brand voice forms a strong impression in your readers’ minds and makes a meaningful statement about your company, so that don’t water down the impact of your brand by incorporating colors, images and other visual elements that veer off the standards you have set to communicate your business through your branding.

### 2. Keep typography consistent

Type family, font styles, and font color choices. All the previous points have more to say than just words, but in general we recommend identifying specific color choices and font styles for headings, subheadings, and body text.

In addition, you should be aware when designing your email that you should not put content in the images, it may be hidden because of the default privileges of certain email clients.

Take a look at [Google web fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for fonts you can use in email clients. Keep in mind web fonts aren't supported in all clients and fallbacks are used instead, for example, sans-serif. Therefore, recipients will be able to see the text of your email anyway.

### 3. Make your content scalable

Emails are only looked at for a few seconds. Therefore long emails are generally recommended to be avoided as at the reader will climpse at it and realize they don't have time to read it. 

Be concise, use headings and paragraphs to break up your content, use lists where appropriate and use enough content to entice the user and give them an option to read more with a call to action.

### 4. Choose appropriate images

Images are another reason to offer your readers a web based solution to make a good balance of content. When a recipient opens your email, images instantly grab their attention. By adding a few pictures, you pull in your reader and enhance the effectiveness of your message at the same time.

Reminder: As we mentioned previously that some email clients will not render images by default, some times only if your address is added to a safe list, so ensure your content makes sense if images were turned off.

You’ll want to always set both width and height attributes on your image tags. Without these specifications in order, some clients will distort the image content.

Positioning the images in your e-mail can get tricky, but avoid using floats at all costs.

As for image storage, it’s recommended that you keep all files in your own web/CDN server or trusted host server if you use MailChimp or any other email platforms. 

Remember the image file size when you choosing the appropriate image. It is important when viewing the email that readers get to view it quickly without waiting, so makre sure you compress images to make them faster.

### 5. Care about call to action (CTA)

Design isn’t art. Everything we create is intended to elicit action on the part of the user. To this end, prominent calls to action are critical for virtually every kind of emails and here for newsletter. Everything about your CTAs should make people want to click on them to do something.

Repeat the same CTA at the end of your email, it can be super-effective at getting that elusive click to do not let your clients scroll all the way to the top of your email just to take the action.

A few tips for creating CTAs:

* Design your email and write your copy around your CTA.
* Make it bold and prominent.
* Don’t clutter the space with a CTA that’s too big or diminish it with one that’s too small.
* Consider (tactful) multiple placements to draw the eye of the reader.
