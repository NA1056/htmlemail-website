<a href="https://www.rocketblocks.me" target="_blank">RocketBlocks</a> help students build and hone the skills they need to succeed in job interviews. They are sending various transactional emails using Amazon SES.

Here we speak with their **CEO, Kenton Kivestu**, about how they made their <a href="https://htmlemail.io#templates">HTML Email templates</a> more professional in half a day.

### What was the challenge you were facing?

Before this, our emails were really janky. **We didn't have the time to invest in figuring out cross-client issues** so we went with really barebones, text-only ones. But we were sending enough emails between invoices, forgot password, booking confirmations etc. that it seemed like a big customer touch point to waste with a really "meh" experience.

### How did HTML Email templates help solve this problem?

Email templates really helped us because we used a slightly modified version, added in our logo, the right social media buttons and **all of a sudden we had a pretty good template** which would provide a good experience across clients and device types (web vs. mobile). They looked significantly better! 

### What were the results?

The process was super simple. We went from discovery, **literally finding the site for the first time, to implemented in production in roughly 1/2 a day**. We we're pretty happy with that.
