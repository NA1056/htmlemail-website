<p>Before you hit send on your campaign, or before you even move your email templates in to your email service provider, it's important to <strong>test your HTML emails</strong>. Do this by sending it to yourself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) email clients don't make it easy to send custom designed HTML emails.</p>
<p>We recommend using Putsmail by Litmus to <strong>send yourself a test email</strong>. We use this for our own testing, it's free and doesn't require sign up.</p>
<div class="align-center wide-section">
  <p><a href="https://putsmail.com/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'img', 'click', 'Putsmail');" target="_blank" rel=”nofollow”><img src="../img/putsmail.jpg" alt="Putsmail HTML Email Tester"></a></p>
</div>
<p>Our <a href="/#templates">email templates</a> are already tested across the 30+ most popular email clients so they are ready to go. However when you change your content or modify the layout you'll definitely want to test them again.</p>
<p>Just create a new test, paste in your HTML, and hit send. Then open your email on your desktop client and mobile client to make sure it looks good.</p>
