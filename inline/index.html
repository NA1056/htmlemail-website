title: Inline CSS for HTML Email
description: Use these tools to inline your CSS styles in HTML for your email templates.
---

<p>As <strong>email clients are unpredictable</strong>, and even today many clients strip styles that are not inlined, it is important to inline your CSS before sending. Don't risk your transactional emails or marketing campaigns falling apart.</p>
<h2>Always Inline Your CSS Before Sending HTML Emails</h2>
<p>We recommend using Juice CSS Inliner. We use this for our own templates and as it is an open source project it is constantly being working on and improved.</p>
<div class="align-center wide-section">
  <p><a href="http://automattic.github.io/juice/" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'img', 'click', 'Juice-inliner');" target="_blank" rel=”nofollow”><img src="../img/juice.jpg" alt="Juice CSS Inliner for HTML Email"></a></p>
</div>
<p>Our <a href="/#templates">email templates</a> come packaged with an inlined version and a non-inlined version so they are ready to go. However once you edit and modify your templates you potentially might have to inline them again. For this we recommend using Juice.</p>
<p>Just paste your HTML in to the input box, see the output being generated, then copy and paste this in to your email service provider.</p>
